The React component should swap the list title `<p>` tag for an `<input>` tag when it is clicked on. 

Pressing enter during editing the title or blurring the input should submit the change and swap the `<p>` back in.

NOTE: It is important to have the `<p>` and `<input>` wrapped in a `<div>` so that the styles will work properly.

ON CLICK -> allow edit name
<div>
  <p onClick={() => setIsEditing(true)}></p>, swapped to <input/>
</div>

ON CHANGE -> .... (controlled component)

ON ENTER OR ON BLURRING:
  - send the updated title to backend
  - if success -> update the title in the frontend (redux store)
  - if not success -> we leave the title as is
  - () => setIsEditing(false) (hide the input, show the p)
